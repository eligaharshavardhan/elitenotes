A deal aimed at ending the US government shutdown has passed the Senate, paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to be broken. After a weekend of negotiations in Washington, a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement.

- The current shutdown is the 
longest on record
 in the US
,
 and until this weekend it appeared that Republican and Democratic lawmakers were locked in a stalemate.

They were able attract eight votes from the other side of the aisle, while losing just one in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who voted against after saying the bill would increase national debt. The deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.
