Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were 
indicted
 in Brooklyn on charges that they 
conspired to illegally

 thrown during games. The two were charged with wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy, among other things.

Highlights:
- According to the indictment:
The defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types and speeds of pitches, and their co-conspirators used that inside information to place wagers on those pitches.
- In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments-funneled through third parties-in exchange for rigging pitches.
- The scheme involved unnamed third-party bettors who allegedly earned over $400,000 on bets involving Clase and Ortiz.

Summary:
Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were 
indicted
 in Brooklyn on charges that they 
conspired to illegally

In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments-funneled through third parties-in exchange for rigging pitches. The scheme involved unnamed third-party bettors who allegedly earned over $400,000 on bets involving Clase and Ortiz. The pitchers, for their part, received kickbacks according to the indictment. In some instances, Clase and Ortiz even provided their coconspirators with money to fund the bets. To organize the scheme, the two used their cellphones during games, which is prohibited by the MLB except under extenuating circumstances. The two are also facing a potential lifetime ban from the sport for violating the league’s rules against betting on their own games. However, if convicted, it’s unlikely they’d be released from prison while still young enough to compete anyway. Clase and Ortiz are facing a possible sentence of up to 65 years.

Why it matters: According to the indictment:
The defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types and speeds of pitches, and their co-conspirators used that inside information to place wagers on those pitches.
