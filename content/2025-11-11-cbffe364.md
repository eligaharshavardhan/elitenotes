Sandisk has released what it says is the world’s smallest 1TB USB-C flash drive, one tiny enough to plug into a laptop and never take out. The Extreme Fit is just a little bigger than the wireless dongle for my Logitech mouse.

Highlights:
- Sandisk describes it as a “leave-in design,” suggesting you can use it as a permanent-ish storage upgrade for your PC.
- It’s available in 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB versions, though it’s that high capacity model that stands out.
- It uses USB 3.2 Gen 1, with transfer speeds of up to 400MB/s (or 300MB/s on the 64GB model) — it’s no speed demon, though that’s hardly the point.

Summary:
Sandisk has released what it says is the world’s smallest 1TB USB-C flash drive, one tiny enough to plug into a laptop and never take out. The Extreme Fit is just a little bigger than the wireless dongle for my Logitech mouse. It’s L-shaped, slotting into a USB-C port but sticking up ever so slightly vertically, rather than out horizontally, to keep it flush when plugged into a laptop (though it does stick out just enough to make sure the laptop lid won’t hit it on the way down!). Sandisk describes it as a “leave-in design,” suggesting you can use it as a permanent-ish storage upgrade for your PC. You’ll want to be careful when lugging your laptop around though — the thin design should reduce the risk of the drive catching on other objects and snapping in the process, but USB-C connectors are fragile, and not designed to withstand much force in that direction. It’s available in 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB versions, though it’s that high capacity model that stands out. It uses USB 3.2 Gen 1, with transfer speeds of up to 400MB/s (or 300MB/s on the 64GB model) — it’s no speed demon, though that’s hardly the point. If you don’t need the full terabyte, 
Suneast
 released an even smaller equivalent in May, which caps at 512GB — but it’s only available in Japan. Sandisk’s model, on the other hand, is 
available to order now
 in the US and elsewhere, starting at $15.99 for 64GB and rising to $117.99 for 1TB.

Why it matters: Sandisk describes it as a “leave-in design,” suggesting you can use it as a permanent-ish storage upgrade for your PC.
