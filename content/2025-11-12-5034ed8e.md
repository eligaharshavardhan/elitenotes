Summary:
Notorious sex offender 
Jeffrey Epstein
 said of President 
Donald Trump
, "I know how dirty donald is," in a 
2018 email thread
 about Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer 
Michael Cohen
 having pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and agreed to cooperate in a federal investigation of the president. Epstein made that remark about Trump to 
Kathryn Ruemmler
, a lawyer who served as White House counsel under former President 
Barack Obama
. Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel at 
Goldman Sachs
. The email thread, which CNBC has not independently verified, is among more than 20,000 documents obtained from Epstein's estate by Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released them on Wednesday. Ruemmler on Aug. 23, 2018, emailed Epstein a link to a 
New York Times op-ed
 by Bret Stephens, which had the headline, "Donald Trump's High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The principled case for impeachment is clear. What's missing is the courage."
The article detailed Cohen's guilty plea and its implications for Trump, who was then in his first term in the White House. Cohen had pleaded guilty to crimes related to making and facilitating hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 presidential election. "I thought you'd find interesting," Ruemmler wrote Epstein, who had been friends with Trump for years before they had a falling out in the early 2000s. She wrote in the same thread, "It makes no difference whether it was his money. Issue is failure to disclose. Plus, fact that he lied his ass off about it makes it clear that he knew it was illegal."
Epstein replied, "You see, I know how dirty donald is."
"My guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. what it means to have your fixer flip," Epstein added. In a separate April 2019 
email
 released by House Democrats, Epstein wrote author Michael Wolff that Trump "knew about the girls," according to a copy of that 
message
 purportedly between the two men. It is unclear what the phrase "knew about the girls" meant. In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice 
Ghislaine Maxwell
 in April 2011, Epstein wrote, "I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump."
Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, "spent hours at my house with" Trump. "He has never once been mentioned," Epstein added in that message. It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said "the dog that hasn't barked."
In an email exchange in December 2015, when Trump was seeking the Republican nomination for the White House, Wolff wrote Epstein, "I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you -- either on air or in scrum afterwards."
Epstein replied, "if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?"
Wolff answered: "I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency."
"You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt," Wolff added. "Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime."
Trump has denied that he knew about Epstein's sexual abuse of underag
