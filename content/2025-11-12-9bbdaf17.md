ElevenLabs struck a deal with actors 
Michael Caine 
and 
Matthew McConaughey
 to AI-generate their voices, the company announced this week. Hollywood and AI have an up-and-down relationship, with AI and its — or lack thereof — guardrails serving among the main concerns that led to the Hollywood strikes a few years ago.

Highlights:
- Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.
- Last year, Meta 
announced that its Meta AI 
would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench.
- With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.
