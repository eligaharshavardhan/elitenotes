President 
Donald Trump
 late Wednesday signed into law a funding bill to end the longest federal 
government shutdown
 in U.S. history. The measure, which will fund government operations through the end of January, was passed by the House of Representatives earlier Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote. "The Democrats tried to extort our country," Trump said before signing the bill in the Oval Office at the 
White House
 to reopen the government after 43 days. Democrats had blocked passage of a funding bill until Sunday, when a bloc of the party's 
Senate
 caucus agreed to support a new funding measure in that chamber, despite it not including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. "Republicans never wanted a shutdown," said the president, who was flanked by Republican leaders of 
Congress
. "People were hurt so badly," Trump said, noting the more than 1 million federal workers furloughed, and the effect on government services for Americans. "We can never let this happen again."
He reiterated his call for the Senate to end a filibuster rule that effectively requires 60 votes to pass legislation, including short-term funding resolutions. Trump did not take questions from reporters after the signing, despite several of them trying to ask about the release by House Democrats earlier in the day of documents from the estate of his former friend, 
Jeffrey Epstein
, the notorious sex offender. He was asked about, but ignored, a question about emails by Epstein referring to him. Trump has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends. House Speaker Mike Johnson
, R-La., before Wednesday's vote, in comments backing the bill on the chamber's floor, said, "My friends, let's get this done."
Just two Republicans in the House voted against the bill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Florida's Greg Steube. All but six Democrats voted against the bill: Adam Gray of California; Maine's Jared Golden; Tom Suozzi of New York; Washington's Marie Gluesenkamp Perez; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Henry Cuellar of Texas. The Office of Management and Budget told federal employees to return to their jobs on Thursday. Earlier Wednesday night, the U.S. Department of Transportation froze the level of 
flight cuts
 it imposed in light of shortages of air traffic controllers during the shutdown. As of Tuesday, 6% of scheduled flights were cancelled at U.S. airports, and that level was set to rise to 10% by Friday. The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and government operations had remained shuttered since then because Senate Democrats overwhelmingly refused to vote for a funding measure that did not extend the boosted ACA credits, which reduce the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for 20 million Americans.

The Senate passed the funding bill on Monday night, a day after the Republican majority won support for it from seven Democrats and one independent senator to barely reach the 60-vote minimum. Under the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to allow Democrats a vote in December on a bill of their choice to extend those boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of that month. Without those tax credits, millions of A
