Enjoy In-Home Setup With Mattress Removal
Need to get rid of your mattress or nervous about lugging your new mattress to your bedroom? I don’t blame you: I worry about the same thing with a bedroom on the third floor. But Naturepedic has you covered with a third-party delivery team that will set up your new mattress in your bedroom, 
and
 dispose of your old one, which is huge. You can’t just throw away a mattress anywhere, so that alone is helpful. This is another offer that’s only within the continental U.S. Choosing this option also usually adds about a week to delivery time, but that’s much better than spending a week (or more!) trying to dispose of the mattress you already have.

Why it matters: One of our favorite brands that checks all the boxes is Naturepedic, which makes some of our favorite 
organic mattresses
 and 
organic sheets
.
