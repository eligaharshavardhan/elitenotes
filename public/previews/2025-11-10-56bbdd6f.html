Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. With the Budget due this month, the debate has focused on how UK chancellor Rachel Reeves can 
restore the headroom against her fiscal targets
 that she thought she had secured last year. That is not unimportant. But other areas of policy are just as important. Among those are the flexibility of labour and housing markets and the performance of schools. All are now at some risk. Moreover, the source of that danger is depressingly clear: the triumph of Old Labour suspicion of markets and competition over New Labour pragmatism. I remember Old Labour well. It had virtues. But it suffered from intellectual defects: it resisted the reality that people respond to incentives, distrusted markets and believed, in the words of Douglas Jay, a minister in the Labour government of 1945-51, that 
“the Gentleman in Whitehall is usually right”
. These attitudes are closely linked. They are not altogether wrong. Markets and decentralised decision-making can indeed go very wrong, notably where public goods and externalities are concerned. But the same is true of the opposite. Friedrich Hayek was right that always preferring regulation over decentralised markets will lead to disastrous results. One example of a return to “Old Labour” is in the labour market. An issue here is continuation of a policy started under the Tories, namely in the minimum relative to the median wage. In 2000, that ratio was a modest 41 per cent. By 2012, it hit 47 per cent. But by 2024, it had reached 61 per cent. France was then the only comparable economy to have an even higher relative minimum wage, at 63 per cent of the median. With such a high minimum wage in the UK, the costs of employment and suppression of wage differentials risk a mixture of structural joblessness with deskilling. It does not seem surprising then that the proportion of people aged 15 to 64 in employment fell by a percentage point between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2025, while nearly all other high-income countries enjoyed rising employment ratios. This government is now intent on introducing tight restrictions on labour market flexibility via its 
employment rights bill
. Among the changes are to be guaranteed-hours contracts, including for agency workers, and guaranteed sick pay, parental leave and protection against “unfair dismissal” from the first day of work. Both the 
Resolution Foundation
 and 
Tony Blair Institute
 have criticised the latter, for good reason. These proposals come together with new quangos and more rights for trade unions.
