          <p>The United States has sent $7.5m to the government of <br/>Equatorial Guinea<br/>, one of the world’s most repressive and corrupt regimes, to accept noncitizen deportees from the US to the West African nation, according to a leading congressional Democrat, current and former state department officials and public government data.

<p>Summary:<br/>The United States has sent $7.5m to the government of <br/>Equatorial Guinea<br/>, one of the world’s most repressive and corrupt regimes, to accept noncitizen deportees from the US to the West African nation, according to a leading congressional Democrat, current and former state department officials and public government data. The money sent to Equatorial Guinea is the first taken from a fund apportioned by Congress to address international refugee crises – and sometimes to facilitate the resettlement of refugees in the US – that has instead been repurposed under the <br/>Trump administration<br/> to hasten their deportation. According to government data, the sum from the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) emergency fund was sent directly to the government of Equatorial Guinea, whose president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has been in power for the last 46 years, and who is accused along with his son, Nguema Obiang, the vice-president, of embezzling millions of dollars from the impoverished nation to fuel their lavish lifestyles. In a letter sent to Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, Jeanne Shaheen, the top-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate foreign relations committee, called the payment “highly unusual” and noted the country’s “history of corruption” and government officials’ “complicity in human trafficking” that raised “serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars”. She also asked what protections if any would ensure that the deportees would not be “vulnerable to human trafficking, human smuggling or human rights abuses”. A copy of the letter was obtained by the Guardian. The letter was first reported by the Associated Press. The deal fits the administration’s contentious third-country deportation push, which has alarmed human rights monitors. UN experts <br/>warned in July<br/> the policy could see people removed to foreign countries within a single day, without adequate legal safeguards or chance to raise torture or persecution concerns. Washington has approached <br/>at least 58 governments<br/> about accepting deportees, often securing agreements through cash payments or diplomatic pressure including travel ban threats. Nearly all the countries involved – including Eswatini, South Sudan and El Salvador – feature in state department reports for serious human rights abuses. “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” said a state department spokesperson in response to an inquiry from the Guardian. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security. “We have no comment</p>

<p>Why it matters: She also asked what protections if any would ensure that the deportees would not be “vulnerable to human trafficking, human smuggling or human rights abuses”.</p>
