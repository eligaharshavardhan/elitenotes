<p>Summary:<br/>Council visited wrong home before Sara Sharif&#x27;s murder<br/>Daniel Sandford,<br/>UK correspondent<br/> and <br/>Joshua Askew,<br/>South East<br/>Surrey Police<br/>Sara&#x27;s body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year<br/>Council staff tried to check on 10-year-old Sara Sharif the day before she was murdered by her father and stepmother, but went to the wrong address, a review has found. Urfan Sharif, 43, and Beinash Batool, 30, were <br/>jailed for life<br/> for Sara&#x27;s murder after her body was discovered at the family home in Woking, Surrey, in 2023 following <br/>two years of abuse<br/>. Services in Surrey failed to identify that Sara was at risk of abuse and did not question unexplained bruising, the review found. This included a failure to properly investigate why Sara started wearing a hijab - that covered the bruising - for &quot;fear of causing offence&quot;. Surrey County Council said it was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; for the findings in the review. Warning: This story contains distressing details<br/>The authority said that it had taken &quot;robust action&quot; to address the findings and would work to implement every recommendation in full. The child safeguarding practice review, published on Thursday, looked at how organisations worked together in the run-up to Sara&#x27;s murder and what lessons can be learned. It said the &quot;seriousness and significance of [Sharif] as a serial perpetrator of domestic abuse was overlooked&quot;. &quot;Sara&#x27;s father and stepmother proved to be a lethal combination,&quot; it said. &quot;And with hindsight, it is clear that they should never have been trusted with the care of Sara.&quot;<br/>&quot;The system failed to keep her safe,&quot; it added. The review also found it was not properly investigated why Sara started wearing a hijab, saying an occupational therapist was reluctant to mention it for &quot;fear of causing offence&quot;. It was later learned that she wore one to hide her injuries. Neighbours also said they &quot;feared being branded as being racist&quot; if they reported concerns. Surrey Police<br/>Sara&#x27;s father Urfan Sharif and stepmother Beinash Batool were sentenced to life imprisonment<br/>Sara was hooded, burned and beaten during the campaign of abuse. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered dozens of injuries including human bite marks, an iron burn and scalding from hot water. The review was commissioned by the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership, which is made up of police, local health organisations and the council&#x27;s children&#x27;s services. Bruising was first noticed on Sara in June 2022, according to the report. In March 2023, staff at St Mary&#x27;s Primary School in West Byfleet contacted Surrey Children&#x27;s Services after spotting three bruises – one the size of a &quot;golf ball&quot; – on her face. She had been off school for two days, with the family stating she was ill. The support request was deemed amber, meaning action should have been decided upon within 24 hours. Surrey Children&#x27;s Services did not make any checks with Surrey Police, which knew of Sharif&#x27;s history of domestic abuse, the review said. It also did not consult the school, which had noticed Sara change from being bubbly to &quot;quiet and coy&quot; – pulling her hijab down over her face. When a social worker spoke to Sharif, he lied and said Sara had marks from being hooked up to machinery when she was born, the review said. No further social work action was decided. The review also found it was not properly investigated why Sara started wearing a hijab from the age of eight, despite it being &quot;highly unusual for such a young child&quot;. It was later learned that she wore one to hide her injuries, it said. A newly qualified occupational therapist visited the</p>

<p>Why it matters: Services in Surrey failed to identify that Sara was at risk of abuse and did not question unexplained bruising, the review found.</p>
